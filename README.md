🎬 Movie Recommendation System (FastAPI + NLP)

This project is a movie recommendation web application that predicts movie genres from a user’s text description and recommends similar movies based on those genres. It uses FastAPI for the backend and a simple HTML/JavaScript frontend.

⸻

🚀 Features
	•	User enters a text description of what they want to watch
	•	NLP model converts text into embeddings using Sentence Transformers
	•	A trained multi-label classification model predicts movie genres
	•	Recommends top 5 movies matching the predicted genres
	•	Simple web interface for interaction

⸻

🧠 Technologies Used
	•	FastAPI - backend API
	•	Uvicorn -ASGI server
	•	Sentence-Transformers - text embeddings
	•	Scikit-learn - multi-label classification
	•	Pandas & NumPy - data handling
	•	Joblib - model loading
	•	HTML / JavaScript - frontend UI

POST /predict

Request body (JSON):

{
  "overview": "I want a dark sci-fi movie with space and action"
